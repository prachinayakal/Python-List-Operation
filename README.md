# Python-List-Operation
Python list operators allow for powerful manipulation of lists, including repetition, concatenation, finding the length of a list, iterating over elements, and checking for membership. These operators enable flexible and efficient list handling.
# Python List Operators

This Python script demonstrates various list operations including repetition, concatenation, finding the length of a list, iterating through list elements, and checking for membership within a list.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.x or higher) installed on your machine.

## List Operations Covered

1. **Repetition (`*`)** - Repeats the list elements a specified number of times.
2. **Concatenation (`+`)** - Concatenates two lists.
3. **Length (`len()`)** - Returns the number of elements in the list.
4. **Iteration (`for`)** - Iterates through the list elements.
5. **Membership (`in`)** - Checks if an element is present in the list.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the Python script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python list_operators.py
    ```

   Or, for Python 3:

    ```bash
    python3 list_operators.py
    ```

## Output

The script will demonstrate various list operations, displaying results such as list repetition, concatenation of two lists, list length, iterating through elements, and checking if certain elements exist in a list.
